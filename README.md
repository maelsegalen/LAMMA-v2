# LAMMA v2

This project is the follow-up of my previous Master's Degree Project called
[LAMMA](https://github.com/poalopat/LAMMA).

The goal remains to provide a simple interface to generate realistic sound
design via motion capture, as if you were a foley artist recording in your
studio.

#### XMM Library

In order to use this project, you will need to build the [XMM](https://github.com/ircam-rnd/xmm)
C++ Library and import it on your project as a DLL.
Mac, iOS and Android versions are available on the IRCAM "XMM-Unity" repo 
[here](https://github.com/ircam-rnd/xmm-unity).
I personnaly used it in order to build the DLL for Windows, you can find
it [here](https://github.com/poalopat/xmm-unity-windows).

#### Usage

Clone this repository and open the MainScene. Import the DLL as explained
in the previous section.

#### Credits

I developped the main parts of this project, except the xmm library part.
For more info about this awesome library and its usage, please head to
its [original repo](https://github.com/ircam-rnd/xmm) and have fun with
the latest ISMM Team Projects from IRCAM, where it was developped.
